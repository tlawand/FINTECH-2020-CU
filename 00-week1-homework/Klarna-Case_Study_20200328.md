## Overview and Origin

Klarna Bank AB (publ) -- *referred to below as Klarna or the Company* -- was founded in 2005 in Stockholm, Sweden by Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Victor Jacobsson, and Niklas Adalberth. The Company currently employs around 2,500 people and is present in 17 countries, including Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.

The company serves around 85,000,000 customers, as well as around 205,000 merchants - processing circa 1,000,000 transactions per day.

Klarna's main business is offering a checkout platform for e-commerce sites that them to provide their customers with a simple buying experience at very competitive rates. When customers checkout with Klarna, they are offered the option to pay for the products once they are delivered, as well as the ability to get financing to cover the cost over installments.

Customers using Klarna don't need to use their credit cards on e-commerce sites, but rather they can use their email address and PO Box instead. Once clients checkout, Klarna pays the merchant, and takes on the credit risk of the customers (and invoices them later). This offering is also known as "Buy now, pay later".

### About the founders
Sebastian Siematkowski earned an M.Sc. degree in Business and Economics from the Stockholm School of Economics in 2007. He cofounded Klarna with Victor and Niklas in 2005, and became CEO and board member of Klarna in 2010. Prior to Klarna, Sebastian had eight years of experience within sales.

Victor Jacobsson also earned an M.Sc. degree in Business and Economic from the Stockholm School of Economics in 2007. He currently serves as an advisor to entrepreneurs on operations and strategy, as well as being a private investor, providing equity investments and seed funding to startups. He is no longer involved in Klarna's operations, but remains as an active shareholder.

Niklas Adalberth earned an M.Sc. in International Business from the Stockholm School of Economics. He held the position of Deputy CEO of Klarna until 2015, and was a member of the board until 2018. Niklas also founded the Norrsken Foundation -- a foundation that supports and invests in both for-profit businesses and non-profit organizations that are believed to have an impact on society (in other words, the foundation follows a socially responsible investing strategy).

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The idea for Klarna came from when Sebastian, Victor, and Niklas (the founders) were attending the Stockholm School of Economics, and after Sebastian and Niklas went on a one-year sabbatical traveling the world by land and sea.

The trio's aim was to offer consumers with the option to pay after receiving the goods they have ordered. They introduced this offering to the market in 2005, a time when consumers were hesitant to shop online at it was widely regarded as unsafe, complicated and frustrating. Separating the payment from the purchase (by allowing customers to pay for the products after they received them), made customers increase their trust in e-commerce (since Klarna eliminated the risk of paying for a product and never receiving it).

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
To date, Klarna has raised around US$1,157.2 million from various venture capital firms including, but not limited to, BlackRock, Sequoia Capital, Visa, Ant Financial Services Group (the Company announced the investment by Ant Financial Services Group in March 2020, but didn't disclose the amount), and Snoop Dogg (although he's famous for music rather than investing). The latest funding round came in at US$200 million with the aim of helping the Company expand operations in Australia. In 2019, the Company raised US$460 million assist with its expansion in the US.

Klarna has also raised around US$553 million in the form of senior unsecured bonds and commercial papers (as stated in their annual financial statement release for the period between January 2019 and December 2019).

## Business Activities:

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Klarna aims to make it easier for people to shop online by making payments simple, safe, and smooth. In other words, the Company aims to remove the friction that comes with online purchases by eliminating the need to enter credit card details and billing information every time you need to make a purchase. Klarna claims that their solution allows customers to complete the checkout process with one step (and a third of the time) compare to the eight steps required by using competing solutions.

By separating the payment from the purchase (i.e. by allowing customers to pay at a later time than when they placed the order), Klarna is also reducing the risk on end customers since they don't have to pay for the products before they receive them.
### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Considering that the Company's main business stems from enabling online purchases, the Company's intended customers are people who are digitally literate (meaning that they know how to use a computer or a smartphone), have access to the internet, and have  enough disposable income to be able to purchase products without having to default on payments.

In it's Annual Financial Release for the period between January 2019 and December 2019, Klarna states a gross merchandise volume of around US$35 billion.

To figure out the *total addressable market* for Klarna, we can look at the e-commerce industry in its countries of presence as a proxy (since, in theory, Klarna could process 100% of e-commerce payments in these countries). As an estimate, we're only going to take the three largest markets that Klarna is present in (United States of America: US$586.92B, United Kingdom: US$141.93B, and Germany: US$81.85B), to get to a total addressable market of US$810.70 billion.

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Klarna offers e-commerce merchants the ability to integrate a simple checkout solution, allowing their customers to purchase products and pay for them at a later time. Klarna's checkout platform offers a frictionless solution for customers compared to the traditional checkout process that the majority of providers offer -- except for PayPal which offers a quick and easy checkout process for existing clients (without, however, the "buy now, pay later" option).

Klarna's advantage over competitors stems from their now deep knowledge of the e-commerce checkout landscape, having been in the business for around 15 years, as well as their seemingly simple solution for merchants and clients alike -- since merchants can make use of the Klarna's API's and partnerships with other payments processors (such as Klarna's recent partnership with Wirecard) to integrated the Company's solutions into their site.

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?
Klarna offers developers two main methods of integrating its services into e-commerce sites:
#### 1. Direct integration
Developers can use Java, PHP, .Net, Objective-C or Javascript to  integrate Klarna into their applications and sites. Klarna provides API interfacing over JSON.
#### 2. Integration with platforms
Klarna offers developers and merchants the ability to integrate the Company's services using third-party providers such as Shopify, Magento Commerce, CyberSource in the US - as an example.

## Landscape:

Klarna is in the payments industry, mainly serving as a payment processor (or provider) for e-commerce and physical stores. Having acquired a banking license in Sweden and partnering with other companies and banks in its other markets, the company is expanding its offerings to customers, and providing longer term financing (up to three years) - making it a more direct competitor to traditional banks and credit card companies than before.

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
The payments industry has shown a steady growth of 6% from the period between 2007 and 2018, with the greatest increase coming from Asia Pacific. This fits well with the change in demographics and purchasing power in the region, as more people move into the middle class, and younger people (who are already used to technology) join the workforce and gain disposable income.

According to Accenture (one of the top management and IT consulting firms), the trends that will be driving the payments industry for the future include:
* Gen Z's entry into the market (as with millennials before them, Gen Z has grown used to living with technology, and online and mobile payments will be second nature to them), 
* The fusion between banks and Fintechs (as more banks partner with Fintechs to maintain relevance and Fintechs leverage the banks' size to gain a competitive advantage).
* The prevalence of mobile payments, which will allow anyone, anywhere, to make online purchases, or become a merchant themselves (with the likes of Square providing card and contactless devices that pair with smartphones and tables).

### What are the other major companies in this domain?
Since Klarna has expanded its operations, and many other companies have joined the race, we can classify their competitors into XX categories:
* Direct competitors (with a similar business model)
	* Bill Me Later
	* Afterpay
	* Billpay
	* Affirm
* Traditional banks in countries of presence (through the use of in-house or acquired technologies)
	* Chase Pay
	* SWIFT Pay Later API's
	* Personal loans
* Traditional payment processors
	* Wirecard
	* Fiserv
* Traditional card companies
	* Visa
	* Mastercard
	* American Express
	* China UnionPay
* E-commerce payment processors
	* Square
	* Stripe
	* PayPal (including its subsidiary, Braintree)
* Peer-to-peer lending firms (which compete with Klarna's longer term financing options)
	* LendingClub
	* Upstart

## Results

Klarna has grown its global merchant number to more than 205,000 merchants, and had 16 million new consumers globally in 2019 (including 6 million from the US alone).

The company has a high client retention rate, with 70% of consumers making multiple repeat transactions over 12 months, and has been ranked the #1 trending app on the Google Play Store in the US (having launched in May 2019). Klarna is also now incorporated in 10,000 in-store solutions, including H&M, Expedia, Abercrombie & Fitch, Microsoft, and others.

The company had a 90% satisfaction rate (meaning that 90% of the shoppers were satisfied when using Klarna), and 85% of shoppers said that Klarna was a better experience than other online checkouts.


## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?
On top of providing end customers with financing, Klarna could offer merchants with working capital financing and business loans (since they process payments for merchants, they have data on cash flows which can help them estimate a merchant's ability to pay back a loan).


### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
This would provide the Company with an even larger market to tackle, and would allow them to increase their revenues from merchants (other than just charging processing fees), and would provide them with lock-in since merchants would then prefer to work with Klarna over others due to the availability of financing options.

Klarna could also use machine learning in order to predict its future revenues from merchants and customers, and be able to better customize their offerings (through the analysis of the retention and satisfaction rates of products or services it offers to both merchants and end customers).

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Klarna would use their current technology stack for API's and potentially need to develop a new machine learning algorithm that would help them estimate the creditworthiness of a merchant  from their past transactions.

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
The use of API's and machine learning in this case would fit, as the Company would be able to analyze its existing treasure of data in order to come up with an algorithm for creditworthiness (as mentioned above), and use API's to offer a simple solution for merchants and third-party developers (including partners) to integrate Klarna into their applications and sites.
